----
- Exercise 1 provides background of this project
- Exercise 2 An unconstrained model is introduced, estimate lifecycle cost of the system based on installation cost and operation cost
- Exercise 3 introduces discount rate r of operation cost, lifecycle cost now is estimated on installation cost and operation cost devided by discount rate r.
